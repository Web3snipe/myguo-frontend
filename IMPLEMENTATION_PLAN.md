# 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Making it a REAL AI Portfolio Manager

## **Root Cause Analysis:**

From API response: `{"totalValue":0,"assets":[],"recentTransactions":[]}`

**The wallets exist but have NO DATA because:**
1. ❌ Blockchain sync isn't running after wallet add
2. ❌ CoinGecko is rate-limited (429 errors)
3. ❌ No manual sync button
4. ❌ No visual feedback during sync

### 4. ADD LOADING STATES 💫
