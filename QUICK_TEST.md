# Quick Test Guide

## Current Issue
The wallet `0x1234` is a test/placeholder wallet with no real blockchain data.

## To Test Properly:

### 1. Remove Test Wallet
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:3001/api/wallets/cmgfr7y250001gndvhvkdsovg?userId=cmgfr7y240000gndvqoi6al9s'
```

### 2. Add Real Wallet via UI
Click "Add Wallet" and use one of these wallets with real data:

**Option A - Small balance wallet (for testing):**
```
0x4D7d5a9254bBC726254FEdb1694C7F21288F043F
```
Has: ~$1.55 in assets, real transactions

**Option B - Larger wallet (more transactions):**
```
0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045
```
Has: Significant balance, many transactions

### 3. Click "Sync All"
Wait 30-60 seconds for:
- âœ… Wallet balance to update
- âœ… Transactions to populate  
- âœ… Chart to draw with data
- âœ… AI labels to appear

### 4. Refresh Page
The chart and transactions should now display properly.

## Why This Happened
- Privy authentication creates a wallet address automatically
- That address (`0x1234`) is not a real Ethereum address
- No blockchain data exists for it
- You need to add actual wallet addresses to track

## Expected Results After Adding Real Wallet:
- Portfolio value shows actual $$ amount
- Chart displays line with historical data  
- Transaction history shows recent txs
- AI labels appear on transactions (ðŸ“¥ Received, ðŸ“¤ Sent, etc.)
